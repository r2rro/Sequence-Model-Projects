## Emojifier
The emojifier code will use word vector representations to make your messages more expressive.

Rather than writing:
>"Congratulations on the promotion! Let's get coffee and talk. Love you!"   

The emojifier can automatically turn this into:
>"Congratulations on the promotion! 👍  Let's get coffee and talk. ☕️ Love you! ❤️"

We will implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as "Let's go see the baseball game tonight!") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (⚾️).
